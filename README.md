# Supervised-learning
A python library for supervised learning methods with PyTorch.

## List of Implementations
This repo has PyTorch implementations of training a ConvNet.
 - Transfer Learning for ResNet18 / ResNet34 / ResNet101 / SqueezeNet
 - Differntial Learning rate (Applying smaller learning rates on earlier layers & higher on later layers for higher performance)
 - [SGDR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03983.pdf) (SGD with Restarts - Accelerates training)
 - [CLR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf) (Cyclic Learning Rate - Accelerates training (uses cosine annealing instead of linear))
 - Training a simple 28x28 network from scratch
 - Basic Dataloaders
 - Segmentation Dataset Loader (WIP)
